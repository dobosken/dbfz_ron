This dbfz.ron is outdated, and has been deprecated.

My latest dbfz.ron, and the required fork of bbscript to use it, can be found here: [GitHub - dobosken/bbscript: Parses BBScript for various Arc System Works Games](https://github.com/dobosken/bbscript)

# Broscar's mixed dbfz.ron for bbscript 0.1

A customized dbfz.ron for use with [Pangaea's bbscript](https://github.com/super-continent/bbscript).

Uses a mixture of nice community-given names and datamined ArcSys names to greatly reduce the amount of Unknown function calls in parsed .bbs scripts.

Over time, more of the internal and somewhat cryptic ArcSys names will be replaced with better community-given names.
